This simple class describes a fictitious tractor. The tractor moves around a field, hopefully without 
falling in any of the ditches which sit around the edge. The driver moves the tractor by issuing commands 
to it (although this role is played by the test at the moment). Currently there are only two commands: 
"Forwards" and "Turn Clockwise". In the future there'll probably be more like "Reverse" but we don't want 
you to implement that right now.

What we do want you to do is refactor the code for us. On our team we like well factored OO code.

***Big Hint: There's a reason we call it the IffyTractor: we don't like to many conditionals.***

Good Luck!
